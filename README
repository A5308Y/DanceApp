Viewing the root page
  shows the list of all courses
  if a user exists
    allows the user to log in

Documentation::RawData
  #generated_rspec_content
    returns the content of the configured rspec_file
  #introduction_content
    returns the content of the configured introduction_file

Documentation::Writer
  #write
    writes the formatted result to the given io stream

Documentation::RspecTrimmer
  the result of #run
    filters rspec output not useful for a documentation:
      should not have lines starting with "Run options"
      should not have lines starting with "Finished in"
      should not show the number of run examples and failures
      should not have lines starting with "Randomized"
      but not lines that have the same words as rspec output in their description:
        should include "Run options"
        should include "Finished in"
        should include "failures"
        should include "Randomized"
    shows rspec's documentation output:
      should start with "Documentation::RspecTrimmer\n  the result of #trimmed\n    should not include \"Randomized\""
    ensures exactly one empty newline:
      should end with the characters "\n"
      should not end with the characters "\n" and "\n"

    should end with "should not include Randomized\nshould not end with characters"

Documentation::Combiner
  #run
    hands the contents of the introcution_file and the trimmed rspec_file to the formatter
